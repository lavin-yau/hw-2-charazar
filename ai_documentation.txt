Input: How to add a git-tag to repostiory 

Output: # Create a tag (lightweight)
git tag v1.0

# Or create an annotated tag (recommended - includes message)
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release with selected data files"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0

# Or push all tags at once
git push origin --tags

My process: I tried to tweak some of the code and realized I need to commit the whole folder first. 

Input: How to create environment named "ligo" and install the dependencies

Output: 
name: ligo
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - jupyterlab
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - ipykernel
  - pip
  - pip:
      - git+https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
üß† Explanation
name: ligo ‚Üí names your environment ‚Äúligo‚Äù.

channels: ‚Üí tells conda where to look for packages.

dependencies: ‚Üí lists the Python version and packages your notebook needs.

The pip: section is optional ‚Äî you can include:

git+https://github.com/... if your notebook depends on another GitHub repo.

or other pip-only packages.

My Process: I went into the READ me and figured out which packages I needed and applied those to this code structure. I used the imports from the tutorial notebook. I then needed to figure out how to make the environment run the code. 

Input: how do i run code in the environment file 

Output: 
To confirm it exists:

conda env list

‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Add the environment to Jupyter as a kernel

Activate it first:

conda activate ligo


Then register it with Jupyter:

python -m ipykernel install --user --name ligo --display-name "Python (ligo)"

My Process: I ran these commands. 

Input: how to remove the 3rd revision number

Output: 
name: ligo
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - numpy=1.26
  - pandas=2.2
  - matplotlib=3.9
  - scipy=1.13
  - jupyterlab
  - pip

then I ran

conda env remove -n ligo
conda env create -f environment.yml

Process: I used this and it worked along with my own additional trouble shooting
