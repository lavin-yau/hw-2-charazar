FOR THE HW 2 SUBMISSION PLEASE VISIT THIS REPO : https://github.com/charazar/hw2-charazar.git
(I did this in my own repo and then had some issues with the transitioning. Jimmy said it is fine to link my personal repo here.)

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._
